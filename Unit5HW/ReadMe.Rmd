## Readme file for Unit 5 HW for Daniel Clark Code Book

# codebook contains 4 files

# file 1 is a markdown for the HW where it includes the code I used to merge and sort and tidy two datasets on baby names and their counts in 2015 and 2016. 

# One of the output CSV files is the resulting y2015 dataset with a correction to one of the baby names that was misspelled

# the other CSV file was for the merged datasets for 2016 and 2015 baby names and filtered by Female only names and sorted by most popular.

# finally there is an HTML file that is included
